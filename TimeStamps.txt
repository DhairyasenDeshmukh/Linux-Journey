#  What is a Timestamp in Linux?

Every file has three important timestamps:

Access time (atime) – Last time the file was read.
Modify time (mtime) – Last time the file content was changed.
Change time (ctime) – Last time metadata (like permissions or name) was changed.

# Why Change Timestamps?

1. Trigger automated tasks
Some scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or build systems (like make) rely on file timestamps to decide if something needs to be rebuilt. If a file looks "newer," it might trigger updates.

$ touch config.yaml   # Pretend config just got updated

2. Fake modification for testing
You may want to test how a system reacts to a file change without editing the content.

Example:

$ touch important.log  # System thinks it was just modified

3. Preserve or sync file timestamps
If you're syncing files across systems (e.g. with rsync), touch can help align timestamps to avoid redundant transfers.

4. Sort or organize files
You can set a custom timestamp to group/sort files by date in a specific way.

$ touch -d "2023-01-01 12:00" report.txt

#  Note:
touch only modifies atime and mtime, not ctime.
