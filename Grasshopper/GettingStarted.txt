Linux system is divided into two main parts:
	- Hardware: This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, 		drives, etc.
	- Linux Kernel: Kernel is the core of Operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
	- User Space: This is where users will directly interact with the system.
